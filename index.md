MoveMate can be installed on all devices with an **Android operating system, from 5.0 version, onwards.** <br>
When you will open it for the first time, you will have to log-in with your **facebook account**, enter your phone number and your institutional email address and the game will be done!

      To create a new route you be able to press '+' button on 'My routes' page, selecting if your final route will be:
        - From University
        - To University
      Then you will have to choose the type of vehicle you will want use (if it will be a motorcycle or car, you be able to
      select the number of free places and if you have an helmet more), the starting or arrival department 
      (it will be possible to choose all departments of an university), the time and the route name with 
      short description (if you will want).
* ### Finding a route made by others
      To find a route from/to university you be able to press the 'hand lens' button on the top bar and then 
      follow requested steps specifying vehicle, price and department.
