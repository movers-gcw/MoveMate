# MoveMate Project

MoveMate helps you to find other student to share your daily trip with.
* Carry other students with your Car/Moto and split the costs
* Find students who walk your own road and take the same transport with them

MoveMate is an application made for university students that will allow to get in touch with other colleagues and plan a trip to the university together.

# How it works

MoveMate can be installed on all devices that has an Android opereting system, from 5.0 version, onwards.
When you will open it for the first time, you will have to log-in with your **facebook account**, enter your phone number and your institutional email address and the game is done!

At this time, you can do two main things:
* Make your route to share it with other students
* Find a route made by others

You can see a short functionality illustration below:
