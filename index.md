# MoveMate Project

MoveMate helps you to find other student to share your daily trip with.
* Carry other students with your Car/Moto and split the costs
* Find students who walk your own road and take the same transport with them

MoveMate is an application made for university students that will allow to get in touch with other colleagues and plan a trip to the university together.

# How it works

MoveMate can be installed on all devices that has an **Android opereting system, from 5.0 version, onwards.**
When you will open it for the first time, you will have to log-in with your **facebook account**, enter your phone number and your institutional email address and the game is done!

At this time, you can do two main things:
* ## Make your route to share it with other students
      To create a new route you can press '+' button on 'My routes' page, selecting if your final route is:
        - From University
        - To University
      Than you have to choose the type of vehicle you want use (if it is a motorcycle or car, you can 
      select the number of free places and if you have an helmet more), the starting or arrival department 
      (it's possible to choose all departments of an university), the time and the route name with 
      short description (if you want).
* ## Find a route made by others
